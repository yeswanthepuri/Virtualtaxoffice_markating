It also allows you to create and maintain your users based on your subscription, and assign each user to a specific role for each of the modules to which you subscribe. Lastly, you can make changes to your subscription, like adding or deleting user or storage allowances for a given module, adding or canceling modules, or even choosing to cancel your entire subscription, online through your subscription management portal.</p>

This module is required for VTO to work, and specifically allows you to define the entities in your organization (including parent-child relationships), and the physical address (including previous address history) for all of your physical locations, whether they are offices, distribution centers, retail stores, or something else. OrgChart also allows you to define your accounting Business Unit structure, and associate it with either an entity or location, so it's easier to export data that is relevant to your general ledger system. OrgChart allows you to import your entity, location, and business unit data to accelerate your initial setup using an Excel template you can download from the import function. You can also export this data to Excel.</p>

              <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">This module allows you to request and store indirect tax exemption certificates from your customers, and issue them to your vendors. We offer email delivery of requests and issuance of certificates, and electronic generation of PDF forms from our certificate library to reduce the need for scanning and uploading files. Your customers can click on a link in the email and submit the documents to you electronically as well, so even THEY don't have to manually fill out, scan, and upload an image. And all electronically generated documents are saved as meta-data only – not counting against your data storage allowance since there's no scanned image file to store. You can send reminders to certificate requests in bulk, so you don't have to spend time seeing who's responded and who hasn't customer by customer. And two patent-pending features allow you to save a lot of time on certificate renewals, too! Our current content covers all U.S. states, Canada and the PST provinces, many tax types, and the common exempt reason types. Currently, the ability to import certificates and requests is not a standard part of VTO, but you can work with one of our consulting partners who can help you get your historical data loaded into the module. Customer and vendor information can be imported and exported. Certificate information for both received and issued certificates can be exported for analysis.</p>

              <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">The Workflow Manager is used for controlling the workflow of common tasks performed by the tax department in a business, using Trackers to manage each type based on that task's typical lifecycle. There are three Trackers currently included in Workflow Manager: Assignment Tracker, which tracks various activities like tax registrations, voluntary disclosure agreements, and research projects; Audit Tracker, which tracks audit history for your entities and each audit through its lifecycle; and Notice Tracker, which tracks notices received from taxing jurisdictions throughout their lifecycle. We will be adding Knowledge Tracker, for maintaining important tax-centric information related to significant historical events, such as acquisitions or transfer pricing agreements, in 2025.</p>
              <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-4">Work Items are assigned to individual users for accountability and effectiveness, and new Work Items can be set up unassigned, creating a "pool" of work for users to grab based on their role within your department. In addition, Tasks can be set up within Work Items and assigned to different users. Tasks are similar to Work Items in that they allow general data of the task to be stored, and also allow attachments and activities, just like their parent Work items.</p>
